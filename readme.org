* Legacy
This repo has existed for a long time and older config was moved to branches. This is new branch orphaning the older code.
I went from very custom config to a generic config in form of spacemacs with minimal layer config. 
This served me well for a long time however spacemacs layer support for languages that i work on has not improved over time and hence the reboot of my emacs config.

* My Emacs config
1) Literate Emacs configuration via org mode and babel
2) Using ~org-babel-load-file~ we loaded this file. The various embedded snippets are the emacs config.
3) code blocks which are annotated as ~emacs-lisp~ will be considered.
4) other code blocks which exists wont be run.
5) any new org file needs to be added to ~init.el~ for load.
6) Mostly just ~use-package~ declaration with glue hooks stitching things together.

* Dependencies
1) These will be in [[file+emacs:install.org]]
